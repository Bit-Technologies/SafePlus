title: 01. Print
descr: The "Hello World" program
code: print "Hello World"
---
title: 02. Variables
descr: >
    A variable is a name for an object.
    It is done via this syntax:

    ```
    variablename = object
    ```
code: |
    x = 1
    y = x + 1
    print x
    print y
---
title: 03. Print Data
descr: The "Hello World" program printing some values.
code: |
    x = "Hello"
    y = 2.123456789
    print "%s World, y = %f" %(x, y)
    print "x={x}, y={y:.3f}".format(**locals())

title: 04. Expressions
descr: Expressions are evaluated, they can consist of operators and function calls.
code: |
    print (5 + 6) * 11
    z = 3
    print (1 + z)**2
    from math import sqrt
    print sqrt(z)
---
title: 05. Functions
descr: >
    A function call is one of the most basic levels of abstraction.
    A common subroutine of evaluations is run with varying initial arguments.
    The `return` statement is very important: data flows back to where the functions has been called.
code: |
    def function1(x, y):
        z = 10 * x + y
        return z

    print function1(4, 5)
    print function1(1,-1)

title: "06. Data Structure: List"
descr: >
    To organize the information in a program, data structures come to help.
    A very basic one is an ordered collection of arbitrary objects.
code: |
    x = [42, "Hello", [1,2,3]]
    print x
    x.append("World")
    print x
