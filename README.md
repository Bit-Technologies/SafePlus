# The SageMath Cloud

The goal of the [SageMathCloud](https://cloud.sagemath.com) project is to create a viable way to do computational mathematics in the cloud using Sage.

This repository contains the parts of SageMathCloud that are open source.  
The license I'm using for this code is BSD.

I don't intend this the code in this repo be immediately and trivally built or usable by anyone with no thought.  I'm just
making sure to get it out there in the open right now.
