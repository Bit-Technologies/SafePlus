                SageMathCloud is a service that may change
                or be shut down at any time without warning.  You agree not to use
                the SageMathCloud to do anything that could cause William Stein or
                University of Washington any trouble; in particular, you agree to not
                send spam, post viruses,
                attack other computers from your account, or do anything illegal.
                You will not
                attempt to bring harm to the system or hack into it.
                You agree <b><i>not to mine for bitcoin</i></b> or other cryptocurrencies, or
                to run bittorrent or other file sharing clients or servers.

                The SageMathCloud is still a beta service and contains many bugs.
                You agree that all
                content that you post to this site has the potential to be
                visible to anybody else on the Internet.
                The resources available to you
                through this service, and these Terms of Usage, may change at any time.
                This free service is not guaranteed to have any uptime, any backups or any
                level of security whatsoever.
                You agree that in order to improve the service, the developers of
                the SageMathCloud may analyze how users use the system (e.g., run
                analytics on user data for internal development use).

                <br><br> You also understand that this software is still in an
                early stage of development, and may contain bugs that could result
                in loss of your data.  THIS SERVICE COMES WITH NO WARRANTY.

                <br><br> If you violate these terms, you will be banned from SageMathCloud.
